      <h1>Reflections on our project</h1>
      <h1>Inspiration and design process by aru</h1>
      <h2>Charcoal and Pencil  </h2>
      <p style="text-align: left;"> Charcoal and pencil were chosen by aru as the main tools for creation of the Daily Cyclical Affirmation Cards because they are two very traditional artistic instruments derived from natural resources such as wood, sawdust, twigs or graphite. Both organic tools allowed a form of expression in drawing that offers a versatile and tactile experience of her own touch. The two encouraged a direct and intimate connection between the hand and the canvas, nurturing a distinctive style and individual expression while contemplating and paying homage to the ancient craftsmanship and illustrative techniques utilized by our ancestors.
 </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>Renaissance Paintings</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left;">aru found inspiration in the era of the European Renaissance (14th-17th century AC), a period synonymous with “rebirth” which marked a renewed interest in art, culture, and humanism. What caught the attention for this project was the pivotal shift in perspectives on femininity, where women’s portrayals gained newfound significance as subjects worthy of artistic representation. While this projects wants to celebrate the womb’s essence,  a “rebirth”-inspired approach from the Renaissance was embraced and also it was aimed to weave in the artistic technique of “chiaroscuro” that characterizes a strong contrast between light and dark elements which allow figures to emerge prominently from the shadows. </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>Diverse Body Types</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left;">In shaping this project, the focus was on portraying persons with a womb space showcasing a diverse array of body types to champion an inclusive and authentic representation of beauty. By challenging conventional beauty norms, the intention was to dismantle harmful stereotypes and to foster a more positive self-image. This approach carries a message of acceptance, celebrating the inherent beauty in the unique characteristics of each individual.
 <br> Note: Due to the inherent variability of body types, not all forms and diversity could have been fully acknowledged and depicted in this project. 

      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>Fruits and Vegetables </h2>
      <p style="text-align: left;">aru drew a metaphorical connection between the ovarian cycle and the enchanting process of fruit and vegetable growth and ripening: she imagined the ovaries akin to the fertile soil from which the diverse array of fruits or vegetables emerges - just like a garden yielding a variety of fruits/vegetables, the ovaries orchestrate the delicate dance of life, producing an array of possibilities and abundance. The analogy underscores the essence of fertility, portraying ovaries as the source of life’s sweet harvest - like a flourishing orchard, the ovaries manifest the potential for new beginnings, each fruit symbolizing the potential for the creation of life in its most delightful forms. The presence of fruits/vegetables in these everyday cards poetically highlights how the ovaries create a fertile space, mirroring the way vegetables or fruits embody the essence of fertility and abundance. </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>Affirmations and Psychology</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Similar to tarot cards, the Daily Cyclical Affirmation Cards are crafted to offer guidance and insight through symbolic, inspiring users to interpret the images in a personally meaningful way. While traditional tarot cards often explore broader aspects of life and destiny, affirmation cards tend to focus on delivering positive messages and fostering personal empowerment, embodying a more uplifting style and purpose. Finally, affirmations, rooted in ancient spiritual practices, have evolved into a scientifically validated method for personal growth, drawing from diverse cultures and philosophies worldwide, and are now recognized for their effectiveness in psychology and neuroscience as contemporary tools for self-improvement and well-being.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>Slow Process </h2>
      <p style="text-align: left;">During the creation of the project, a slow process of creating one card per day was a deliberate process that aligned with the rhythm of aru’s own ovarian cycle, fostering a deeper connection between her and the artistic expression of this project where she tried to follow the expression of each phase and day. By intertwining the creative process with the ovarian cycle, it allowed the artwork to reflect and embrace the fluctuating energies and emotions experienced throughout menstrual phases, offering a daily wellspring of encouragement and empowerment. The deliberate, unhurried pace of this slow process should mirror the natural rhythm of both inner and outer experiences more authentically, standing in contrast to the often artificial and disconnected nature of fast-paced processes. After aru had created the art, duaraconcept followed the same approach with her affirmations.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>Color Wheel</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left;">aru intentionally integrated the rich palette of the cyclical color wheel, to aim to illuminate the diverse spectrum of colors, moods, expressions, and feelings observed in nature, particularly emphasized in the rhythmic transitions across our four seasons - spring, summer, autumn, and winter. By emphasizing earthy and pastel tones it should not serve only to mirror the grounding elements inherent in nature but also evoke a rooted mood that resonates with our nervous system. Finally, the color selection seeks to foster a visual narrative that weaves together the diversity of nature and human experiences, drawing inspiration from both the natural world and the nuances of our emotional landscapes.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>Earth and Grounding</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Since during fluctuating phases of the ovarian cycle, grounding practices such as mindful walks on natural terrain or simply embracing moments on the earth, can significantly contribute to a sense of stability and balance, aru chose soil-like colors as the predominant hues on each canvas. The rationale behind this choice lies in the belief that by establishing a profound connection with the earth during the ovarian cycle we can have the capability to ground ourselves and align with the natural rhythm of our bodies. By fostering this connection, individuals may find increased resilience, emotional well-being, and a harmonious alignment with the cyclical nature of their reproductive journey. 
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>Moon Phases</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Since the waxing and waning of the moon and the metaphorical association with the stages of the menstrual cycle has deep historical roots which creates a symbolic connection that resonates across various belief systems and cultural traditions, aru felt the urge to depict the moon on each card. Some belief systems and cultural traditions connect the full moon to fertility and the peak of the ovarian cycle, aligning with the notion that both lunar and menstrual cycles are approximately 28 days long. The interplay between the moon's phases, the menstrual cycle, and cultural ceremonies (lunar festivals, moon ceremonies, harvesting and planting activities, moon-based rituals as part of personal well-being, acknowledgement of the moon’s influence on bodily cycles, symbolic festivals, letting go rituals, and else) weaves a fascinating narrative that spans centuries. This tapestry not only reflects the interconnectedness of nature and human experience but also underscores the enduring significance of celestial rhythms in shaping cultural practices and personal rituals.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>Various Emotions</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left;">The interplay between emotions and the menstrual cycle unfolds as a dynamic and intricate dance, shaped by the ebb and flow of hormonal changes throughout the ovarian cycle and the phases of a cycle exert a profound impact on emotional experiences, shaping a person’s inner landscape in a cyclical manner. Since the synergy between emotions and the menstrual cycle is a multifaceted interplay, woven into the fabric of people with menstrual cycle’s experiences, aru wanted to give allowance, recognition, and expression of a diverse range of feelings so that the cards can find broad correspondence and support. The creation and utilization of these cards should stand as an affirmation to the recognition and celebration of the cyclical journey, offering a tangible and empowering tool for navigating the emotional nuances inherent in the ovarian cycle. 
<br>
        Note: Due to the inherent variability of individual cycles, not all emotions and fluctuations could have been fully acknowledged and depicted in this project since we have to recognize the unique and diverse experience within each menstrual cycle. 
        </p>

      <h1>Cyclical wisdom by duaraconcept</h1>
      <h2>Circadian and infradian rhythm
      </h2>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Do you notice a change in your energy, body, mind and feelings during the month? The changes are based on the ever-changing hormones of the menstrual cycle, which can roughly be categorized into 4 phases and show a resemblance to the four seasons of nature. The only difference is that the menstrual cycle starts with winter (day 1 = start of the period). Always remember that this is a textbook cycle, which is supposed to be an orientation - there are as many variations to it as there are women on earth.
        <br style="text-align: left;">MENSTRUATION (~days 1-5) • Winter • when hormones are lowest • shedding of uterine lining “letting go of everything that no longer serves, setting of new intentions for the new cycle” 
        
        <br style="text-align: left;">FOLLICULAR (~days 6-13) • Spring • Estrogen rises • growth "striving, social, planning"
        <br style="text-align: left;"> OVULATION (~day 14) • Summer • Estrogen peaking • fertile “time to shine, juiciness is ON” 
        
        <br style="text-align: left;">LUTEAL (~days 15-29) • Autumn/Fall (most misunderstood time of the cycle) • Progesterone-dominant phase • hormones think you're pregnant “focus, problem-solving, intuition, truth-speaking”
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Four phases of the menstrual cycle: feeling all the feels</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left;">The ovarian and menstrual cycle are just some of many phases and cycles that a woman experiences. Think of certain life stages or relevant life events from the first bleed (menarche), birthing of babies or projects, and the phase of menopause transitioning a woman into her very wise years. This deck also serves to re-connect to the cyclical wisdom of life and about the cyclical nature of women in particular.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: left;">The ovarian and menstrual cycle are just some of many phases and cycles that a woman experiences.

      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>We are nature: moon connection</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left;">The moon is a beautiful symbol on the outside reminding us about the cyclicality of life and of us women. Just like the waning and waxing of the moon, women are constantly changing, dying and being reborn through every menstrual cycle. In many traditions the moon is associated with the feminine (yin) whereas the sun symbolizes the masculine (yang). Women can also feel a deep connection to the moon, as the cycle is also around 28 days. We are nature!
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>Cyclical living as empowerment</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Knowing about the menstrual cycle and the hormonal changes during the cycle is empowering because the change in feelings, emotions, energy levels and body and thought patterns are no longer an overwhelming surprise (just imagine the moment, when you are not surprised that PMS is kicking-in), but an opportunity to better understand yourself. Cyclical living is a wonderful way to get to know yourself better, understand your needs, feel healthier and happier, and achieve goals and objectives in life with ease.

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        Krista Handorfer is the founder of duaraconcept, a holistic way of
        living with the menstrual cycle to re-connect to the female body and the
        self through yoga and cyclical wisdom. She specializes in yoga for
        women’s health and wellbeing, self-care practices and hormone balance to
        overcome cyclical and hormonal challenges, like painful periods or the

      <h2>Our history</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        The two open-minded, free spirited, mindful, deeply feeling women met on
        a student exchange in St. Petersburg in 2013 and never split again
        afterwards. Their passion for yoga, nature connection, creativity,
        technology, authenticity, continuous learning, and the way of the
        feminine has built their friendship into co-operation and creation of
        beauty. After aru created the logo for Krista for duaraconcept, they
        continued their creative journey. The result of their second project is
        an earthy feminine deck that supports your daily connection to yourself,
        your cycle, nature, your community, your purpose, and by that equipping
        you with this little spark of joy and a feeling of being home in
        yourself. Enjoy!

      <h2>The collaboration of Daily Cyclical Affirmations</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        This Daily Cyclical Affirmation Deck is a mindful collaboration between
        aru and duaraconcept. As aru initiated the project, duaraconcept
        immediately jumped on board. Then both worked carefully on the general
        concept. After that aru created art, design, analog and digital card
        deck and app, and duaraconcept developed the mindful affirmations.
        Finally, they both wrote about their processes and knowledge which you can read in the "About" section.
